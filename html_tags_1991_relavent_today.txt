HTML Tags

This is a list of tags used in the HTML language. Each tag starts
with a tag opener (a less than sign) and ends with a tag closer (a
greater than sign). Many tags have corresponding closing tags which
identical except for a slash after the tag opener. (For example, the
TITLE tag).

Some tags take parameters, called attributes. The attributes are given
after the tag, separated by spaces. Certain attributes have an effect
simply by their presence, others are followed by an equals sign and
a value. (See the Anchor tag, for example). The names of tags and
attributes are not case sensitive: they may be in lower, upper, or
mixed case with exactly the same meaning. (In this document they
are generally represented in upper case.)

Currently HTML documents are transmitted without the normal SGML framing
tags, but if these are included parsers will ignore them.

Title
-----

The title of a document is given between title tags:

    <TITLE>...

The text between the opening and the closing tags is a title for the
hypertext node. There should only be one title in any node. It should
identify the content of the node in a fairly wide context, and should
ideally fit on one line.

The title is not strictly part of the text of the document, but is
an attribute of the node. It may not contain anchors, paragraph marks,
or highlighting. the title may be used to identify the node in a history
list, to label the window displaying the node, etc. It is not normally
displayed in the text of a document itself. Contrast titles with headings.


Anchors
-------

The format of an anchor is as follows:

    <A ...>...</A>

The text between the opening tag and the closing tag is either the
start or destination (or both) of a link. Attributes of the anchor
tag are as follows.

HREF
    If the HREF attribute is present, the anchor is sensitive text:
    the start of a link. If the reader selects this text, he should be
    presented with another document whose network address is defined by
    the value of the HREF attribute. The format of the network address
    is specified elsewhere. This allows for the form HREF=#identifier
    to refer to another anchor in the same document. If the anchor is
    in another document, the attribute is a relative name, relative to
    the documents address (or specified base address if any).

NAME
    The attribute NAME allows the anchor to be the destination of
    a link. The value of the parameter is that part of a hypertext address
    which follows the hash sign.

TYPE
    An attribute TYPE may give the relationship described by the
    hypertext link. The type is expressed by a string for extensibility.
    Strings for types with particular semantics will be registered by
    the W3 team. The default relationship if none other is given is void.

All attributes are optional, although one of NAME and HREF is necessary
for the anchor to be useful.


Literal text
------------

These styles allow text of fixed-width characters to be embedded absolutely
as is into the document. The format is:

    <XMP>
    ...
    </XMP>

The text between these tags is to be portrayed in a fixed width font,
so that any formatting done by character spacing on successive lines
will be maintained. Between the opening and closing tags:

  * The text may contain any ISO Latin printable characters, including
    the tag opener, so long as it does not contain the closing tag in
    full.

  * Line boundaries are significant, and are to be interpreted as a move
    to the start of a new line.

  * The ASCII Horizontal Tab (HT) character should be interpreted as the
    smallest positive nonzero number of spaces which will leave the number
    of characters so far on the line as a multiple of 8. Its use is not
    recommended however.

The XMP tag is portrayed in a font so that at least 80 characters will
fit on a line but is otherwise identical to LISTING.

The examples of markup are here given using the XMP tag.


Paragraph
---------

This tag indicates a new paragraph. The exact representation of this
(indentation, leading, etc) is not defined here, and may be a function
of other tags, style sheets etc. The format is simply

    <P>

(In SGML terms, paragraph elements are transmitted in minimised form).


Headings
--------

Several levels (at least six) of heading are supported. Note that
a hypertext document tends to need less levels of heading than a
normal document whose only structure is given by the nesting of headings.

H1 is the highest level of heading, and is recommended for the start
of a hypertext node. It is suggested that the first heading be one
suitable for a reader who is already browsing in related information,
in contrast to the title tag which should identify the node in a wider
context.

    <H1>, <H2>, <H3>, <H4>, <H5>, <H6>

These tags are kept as defined in the CERN SGML guide. Their definition
is completely historical, deriving from the AAP tag set. A difference
is that HTML documents allow headings to be terminated by closing
tags:

    <H2>Second level heading</H2>


Address
-------

This tag is for address information, signatures, etc, normally at
the top or bottom of a document. typically, it is italic and/or right
justified or indented. The format is:

    <ADDRESS>
    text ...
    </ADDRESS>


Glossaries
----------

A glossary (or definition list) is a list of paragraphs each of which
has a short title alongside it. Apart from glossaries, this format
is useful for presenting a set of named elements to the reader. The
format is as follows:

    <DL>
    <DT>Term
    <DD>definition paragraph
    <DT>Term2
    <DD>Definition of term2
    ...
    </DL>


Lists
-----

A list is a sequence of paragraphs, each of which is preceded by a
special mark or sequence number. The format is:

    <UL>
    <LI>list element
    <LI>another list element ...
    </UL>

The opening list tag must be immediately followed by the first list
element. The representation of the list is not defined here, but a
bulleted list for unordered lists, and a sequence of numbered paragraphs
for an ordered list would be quite appropriate. Other possibilities
for interactive display include embedded scrollable browse panels.

Opening list tags are:

UL
    A list multi-line paragraphs, typically separated by some white
    space.

the closing tag must obviously match the opening tag.
